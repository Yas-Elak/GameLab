# GameLab

## An implementation of several classic games for the Android platform.

Included games are:
  * Minesweeper
  * Boggle
  * Tic-Tac-Toe
  * _coming soon:_ Snake

The application uses a number of data constructs & collections that are built into the Java language,
including ArrayList & HashSet, as well as a customized singly-linked list to handle the user's
word selection in Boggle. A number of Android libraries (Java) and layout attributes (XML) were
specified and used for styling and functionality.
